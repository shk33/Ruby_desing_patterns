Desing Patterns implement in Ruby
====================

12 most common design patterns implemented in Ruby.
The book reference is "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"  by Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides, Richard Helm, and Erich Gamma.
The code is taken from the Tutplus course titled "Design Patterns in Ruby"

Template Method Pattern
"Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template method lets subclasses redifine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure"

Strategy Pattern
"Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it"

Observer Pattern
"Define a one-to-many dependency betwee objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependencies are notified and updated automatically "

Iterator Pattern
"In object-oriented programming, the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled."
